# Motosport Discord Bot

---

## Description:

Bot to run in [Discord](https://discord.com/) to let me and my friends know some statistics regarding Formula 1 - for
now, planning to expand.

In order to get this, the information is gathered from [Ergast API](http://ergast.com).

This project uses Java 21, [Spring Boot Reactive](https://spring.io/reactive)
and [Discord4J](https://github.com/Discord4J/Discord4J) to facilitate the configuration and communication with Discord.
